<h2><a name="HowTo"></a>How-to: Creating and running simulations</h2>
In this window, you can define up to four simulations simultaneously. A simulation is characterized by a combination of genotype (<a href="Genotype.html">Genotype window</a>) and feeding schedules for milk replacer, concentrate and forage (<a href="Schedules.html">Schedules window</a>), the latter depending on defined feeds of each type (<a href="Feed.html">Feed window</a>).<br><br>

The simulations running simultaneously will cover the same time or live weight range (depending on your preference). The initial weight should exceed 40 kg, but <span class="incorrect"><em>the model is only evaluated in the live weight range of 80 to 240 kg</em></span>. Once all required information is filled out, click <b>&#10004; Save</b> and the simulation can be started; up to four specified simulations will run consecutively. <br><br>

The results are shown in the <a href="Output.html">Output window</a>, but are not stored in the database permanently. Only basic information that is used in the simulation, i.e. genotypes, feed, feeding schedules and the simulated combination of the previous, are saved. If one of these (e.g. a genotype) has been deleted, re-running the simulation will result in an error message.<br><br>
