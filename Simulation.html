<h2><a name="Buttons"></a>Buttons</h2>



<b><b>New</b><br>

</b>Define a new simulation<br>



<br>



<b>Copy</b><br>



Copy the selected simulation<br>

<b>Delete</b><br>



Delete the selected simulation<br>



<br>



<b>Save</b><br>
save the newly defined or changed simulation in the database<br>

You will save the settings of the simulations only, not the outputs! <br>

Undo the changes to this record since last save<br>



<br>


<b>Print</b><br>


Generate a report for viewing, exporting and printing. The report is in HTML format.<br>

<br>

<b>Start simulation(s)</b><br>

After you have specified the required information, you can start the simulations.<br>



<h2><a name="Fields"></a>Fields</h2>



<b>Name</b><br>



enter the name of your simulation (max 15 characters) <br>



<br>



<b>Description</b><br>



enter a description<br>



<br>


<b>Initial live wt</b><br>


enter the starting weight for the simulation.<br>

It has to exceed 40 kg. <br>

<br>

<b>Simulation stops at</b><br>

you can choose between stopping the simulation at a target weight or after a specified number of days. <br>

<br>

<b>Dressing percentage</b><br>

enter the dressing percentage that you want to use for the calculation of "net paid weight".<br>

It will not affect any of the other output parameters <br>

<br>

<b>Genotype</b><br>

select the genotype that you want to use for this simulation <br>

<br>

<b>Feeding schedule</b><br>

select the feeding schedule that you want to use for this simulation.<br>



<h2><a name="Functionality"></a>Functionality of the simulation window</h2>
In this window, you can define up to 4 simulations.<br>

A simulation is characterized by a combination of genotype (see <a href="Genotype.html">Genotype window</a>) and feeding schedule (see <a href="Schedules.html">Feeding schedule</a> window).<br>

All simulations that you want to run simultaneously should cover the 
same time or live weight range (depending on your preference).<br>

The initial weight should exceed 40 kg, but it must be noted that the 
model is only evaluated in the live weight range of 80 to 240 kg.<br>

After providing the necessary information, you can start the simulations, which will be performed after each other.<br>

The results can be viewed in the <a href="Output.html">Output</a> window, but are not stored in the database permanently.<br>

You can save the basic information, like genotypes, feeds, and feeding schedules, but not the results of a simulation.<br>

If you try to rerun an old simulation and you have in the mean time deleted for example the genotype used,<br>

you cannot perform this simulation and will be notified by means of an error message.<br>

The dressing percentage that you have to specify will only be used for 
the calculation of net paid weight, a common Dutch parameter.<br>

Simon will also predict a dressing percentage, which can be viewed in the output window.<br>
