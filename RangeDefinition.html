<h1>Range definition<br>
</h1>




If you chose in the <a href="Output.html">Output window</a> for output per time or weight range, you can choose predefined ranges from a drop-down list there.<br>

In this window, you can define them. You can choose between ranges based on Weight or on Time. <br>

<br>

New<br>

create a new range definition, name (max 16 characters) and save it. <br>

<br>

Copy<br>

copy the selected range definition <br>

<br>

Delete<br>

delete the selected range definition <br>

<br>

Save<br>

save the newly made range definition <br>

<br>

Restore<br>

undo changes since the last save <br>

<br>

Close<br>

<h3>Make a range definition</h3>

After choosing either a range definition based on time or based on weight, you can set each range by entering its end point.<br>

It is assumed that the first defined end point starts from day 0 and
that each end point will be the beginning of the next range.<br>

The last end point does not necessarily match the end of a simulation.<br>

You can insert new ranges by pointing the cursor to the bottom of the list and entering a new end point.<br>

The list will automatically be sorted.<br>

<h3>Important: be careful choosing small ranges... </h3>

If you specify small ranges (let's say a couple of kilos LW) you have to
 realize that averages are always calculated on a time basis,<br>

and that averages over a weight range are always calculated based on the days closest to the desired beginning and end points.<br>

It may occur that a defined range is smaller than the calf grows in one day on your feeding schedule.<br>
