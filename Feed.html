<blockquote><b>New</b>: Define a new feed. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Copy</b>: Copy the selected feed. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Delete</b>: Delete the selected feed.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Save</b>: Save a newly defined or changed feed.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Restore</b>: Undo changes since last save. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Ingredients</b>: Define the composition of ingredients used in the feed (% of total, adding up to 100%).<br>
	After specification of the ingredients, default values are generated for the nutrient composition, degradation factors and amino acid composition. You can change these default values freely and save the feed for use in the simulation model. Re-adjusting the ingredients afterwards will generate new default values, replacing the current values. Changes you may have made to default values will be lost! More information can be found on the <a href="Ingredients.html">Ingredients</a> help page. <br>

<h2 id="HowTo">How-to: Creating and adjusting feeds</h2>
<em>Similar for milk replacers, concentrates and forages.</em><br><br>

The feed window can be used to build and maintain a database consisting of different feeds (milk replacers, concentrates and forages separately). These feeds can be used to create <a href="Schedules.html">feeding schedules</a> which are used for simulations.<br><br>

To create a new feed, either click on the <b>new</b> button or select an existing feed and <b>copy</b> it. Next, open the Ingredients window and specify the contribution (in %) of all separate ingredients, adding up to 100% in total. After saving the ingredients (click <b>&#10004; Ok</b>), the nutrient contents for each type of feed are generated based on the ingredient composition, but can be adjusted manually if desired. Degradation rates of fibre, protein and starch in the rumen and amino acid composition of the feed are also specified. <br><br>

If values are manually changed but the ingredient list is updated afterwards with a different ingredient composition, the default values will be generated again, <em>this will discard previous manual changes!</em> Once all values are as desired, the feed can be saved (click <b>&#10004; Save</b>) and used in a feeding schedule.<br><br>

<em>More specific information on how to specify the ingredient composition is found on the <a href="Ingredients.html">Ingredients</a> help page.</em><br>

<br>
<h3>Generating default values</h3>
<blockquote>

<span class="incorrect"></span>
<span class="incorrect"><b>Total carbohydrates</b>: calculated as dry matter - crude ash - crude fat - crude protein; for personal information only. Not used for simulations, calculated after the crude protein content is known. Crude protein content depends on the protein source.<br><br>

<b>Digestible crude fat</b>: apparent faecal crude fat depends on fat content and digestibility, which in turn depends on protein source. For example, vegetable protein sources may reduce fat digestibility compared to animal protein sources.<br><br>

<b>Digestible lactose</b>: apparent faecal lactose depends on lactose content and digestibility; the latter is assumed to be 90% at the terminal ileum and 100% at the faecal level. Energy yield of intestinal lactose fermentation is assumed to be slightly lower than enzymatic digestion (yields glucose and galactose). Therefore, default apparent faecal digestibility coefficient is set to 95%. <br><br>

<b>Digestible starch</b>: apparent faecal digestible starch depends on the starch content and digestibility; the latter decreases with an increasing starch content, but increases with an increasing protein content of the feed. Default digestibility thus depends on both  starch and protein content. <br><br>

<b>Crude protein</b>: depends on nitrogen content and nitrogen:protein ratio; the latter depends on protein source. A weighted average of protein:nitrogen ratios of all protein sources is used to calculate protein content.<br><br>

<b>Digestible crude protein</b>: true digestible protein depends on protein content and digestibility; the latter depends on protein sources specified. SiMON uses true protein digestibility (as opposed to apparent  digestibilities for other nutrients) because net endogenous losses at the terminal ileum are simulated as an output of visceral protein. Apart from the true digestibilities, these net endogenous losses depend on protein source and can be adjusted (Endogenous Prot Factor).<br><br></span>

<b>Amino acids</b>: individual amino acids depend on selected protein sources. For each protein source, an amino acid profile is available; default amino acid composition is calculated as a weighted mean of all selected protein sources. This profile can be adjusted. To guarantee a fixed relationship between crude protein content and the sum of amino acids; the content of "other" amino acids are calculated by difference of crude protein and the sum of listed amino acids. For each amino acid, SiMON assumes the true digestibility value for protein. Apparent digestibilities may differ between amino acids, as the amino acid profile of the endogenous protein losses differs from that of feed protein.<br><br>

<b>Endogenous protein losses</b>: By default, endogenous losses at the terminal ileum are based on the ileal nitrogen flux in calves fed milk proteins only. It is assumed that these milk proteins have completely disappeared at the terminal ileum. For each available protein source, a multiplication factor for the endogenous protein losses is available, relative to that of milk
proteins (multiplier, default set to one). The generated default value is a weighted mean for the selected protein sources and can be adjusted.
