<b>Protein sources</b><br>

Define the protein sources used (in % of total protein, NOT in % of the total feed).<br>

Protein sources can be selected after the nutrient composition of the
feed is known: moisture, nitrogen, ash, fat, lactose and starch.<br>

After specification of the protein sources you will return to this window and you will find default suggestions<br>

generated for total carbohydrates, digestible fat, digestible lactose,
digestible starch, total and digestible protein, amino acid composition<br>

and a multiplication factor for basal endogenous protein losses (the latter two in a separate sheet).<br>

You can change these defaults to your liking, and the changes you make will be saved when saving the feed.<br>

If you enter the protein sources window again, new defaults will be generated which will replace the current values.<br>

Changes you may have made will be lost. You will be warned before this occurs.<br>

More information can be found in the <a href="ProtSrc.html">protein sources</a> window. <br>

<h3>
The nutrient sheet</h3>

<b>Moisture</b><br>

moisture content (g/kg) <br>

<br>

<b>Nitrogen</b><br>

nitrogen content (g/kg) <br>

<br>

<b>Crude ash</b><br>

crude ash content (g/kg) <br>

<br>

<b>Total carbohydrates</b><br>

total content of carbohydrates (g/kg), calculated by difference between
dry matter, protein, ash, and fat, assuming absence of crude fibre.<br>

It is calculated after specification of protein sources and is for your information only.<br>

It is not used in any of the calculations and cannot be changed. <br>

<br>

<b>Crude fat</b><br>

crude fat content (ether extract, g/kg) <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible crude fat</b><br>

apparent faecal digestible crude fat content (g/kg).<br>

A default value will be generated after specification of the protein sources (they affect fat digestibility).<br>

This default can be changed <br>

<br>

<b>Lactose</b><br>

lactose content (g/kg) <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible lactose</b><br>

apparent faecal digestible lactose content (g/kg).<br>

A default value will be generated after specification of the protein sources.<br>

This default can be changed. <br>

<br>

<b>Starch</b><br>

starch content <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible starch</b><br>

apparent faecal digestible starch content (g/kg).<br>

A default value will be generated after specification of the protein
sources (protein content as well as starch content affect starch
digestibility).<br>

This default can be changed. <br>

<br>

<b>Protein</b><br>

crude protein content (=N x protein factor)<br>

After specification of the protein sources, a default value is generated (the protein factor depends on the protein source).<br>

This value cannot be changed. <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible protein</b><br>

true digestible crude protein content (g/kg).<br>

A default value will be generated after specification of the protein sources (they affect protein digestibility).<br>

This default can be changed. <br>

<h3>Amino acid sheet</h3>

<b>All amino acids</b><br>

contents of the feed (including water, g/kg).<br>

After specification of protein sources, a default value is selected.<br>

This default can be changed <br>

<br>

<b>Endogenous protein factor</b><br>

a multiplier which you can use to modify the net protein losses at the terminal ileum.<br>

A default value will be generated after specification of the protein
sources (they affect endogenous protein secretions differently).<br>

This default can be changed. <br>

<br>

<b>Sum of non essential amino acids</b><br>

sum of non essential (dispensable) amino acids in the feed:<br>

asparagine + aspartic acid + serine + glutamine + glutamic acid + glycine + alanine +proline (including water, g/kg).<br>

This sum is calculated by difference between the crude protein content,
the sum of essential amino acids (without water!) and the non-protein
nitrogen mass.<br>

It is a calculated field and cannot be changed.<br>


<h2><a name="Functionality"></a>Functionality of the feed window</h2>


The feed window can be used to build and maintain a database of different feeds.<br>

All feeds that appear in the selection list are available to make a&nbsp; <a href="Schedules.html">feeding schedule</a> and can therefore be used in a simulation.<br>

It was decided to enter nutrient contents directly rather than calculating them from the ingredient composition.<br>

The only exception to this rule is that protein sources can be specified.<br>

The reasoning behind this is that important effects of protein sources on digestibility of nutrients in preruminants.<br>

Obviously, protein sources differ in their protein digestibility, but
also effects on for example fat digestibility have been shown to exist.<br>

Simon uses digestible nutrients to start a simulation.<br>

In this window, nutrient contents have to be specified: moisture, nitrogen, crude ash, crude fat, lactose and starch.<br>

Please note that at the time of development of this model, no fibre sources were fed to preruminant calves.<br>

Subsequently, protein sources have to be specified in a separate window.<br>

When finished, you will return to the feed window and Simon will generate default values for <br>

<ul>

  <li>digestible crude fat</li>
  <li>digestible lactose</li>
  <li>digestible starch</li>
  <li>crude protein</li>
  <li>digestible crude protein</li>
  <li>all amino acids</li>
</ul>

You can choose to change these defaults if you wish and save the feed.<br>

When retrieving this feed, you can enter the protein sources window again,<br>

but when returning to the feed window, new defaults will be generated, replacing the values you may have changed.<br>

You will be warned before this happens.<br>

<h3>Generating default values</h3>

<b>Total carbohydrates</b><br>

is calculated as dry matter - crude ash - crude fat - crude protein and is for your information only.<br>

It is not used for simulations and will be calculated after the crude protein content is known.<br>

This depends on the protein source. Therefore, it will be calculated after you have specified the protein sources. <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible crude fat</b><br>

the content of apparent faecal crude fat depends on the crude fat content and its digestibility.<br>

The latter depends on protein source.<br>

For example, when compared with skimmed milk powder, almost all
vegetable protein sources have been shown to depress the crude fat
digestibility. <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible lactose</b><br>

The content of digestible lactose (apparent, faecal) depends on the lactose content and its digestibility.<br>

The latter is assumed to be 90% at the terminal ileum and 100% at the faecal level.<br>

The energy yield of fermentation of lactose in the hindgut is assumed to
 be slightly lower compared with enzymatic digestion (yields glucose and
 galactose).<br>

Therefore, the default apparent faecal digestibility coefficient is set to 95%. <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible starch</b><br>

The content of digestible starch (apparent, faecal) depends on the starch content and its digestibility.<br>

The latter decreases with an increasing starch content, but increases with an increasing protein content of the feed.<br>

The default digestibility value therefore depends on both the starch and the protein content of the feed. <br>

<br>

<b>Crude protein</b><br>

the crude protein content depends on the nitrogen content and on the nitrogen to protein ratio.<br>

The latter depends on the protein source.<br>

After specification of the protein source, a weighted average of the
protein to nitrogen ratios of all protein sources is used to calculate
the protein content of the feed. <br>

<br>

<b>Digestible crude protein</b><br>

The content of true digestible protein depends on the protein content and its digestibility.<br>

The latter depends on the protein sources specified.<br>

Simon uses the true protein digestibility (as opposed to apparent
digestibilities for other nutrients) because net endogenous losses at
the terminal ileum are simulated as an output of visceral protein.<br>

Apart from the true digestibilities, also these net endogenous losses
depend on protein source and can be adapted by the user in the amino
acid window. <br>

<br>

<b>Amino acids</b><br>

the contents of individual amino acids depend on the selected protein sources.<br>

For each protein source, an amino acid profile is available, and the
default amino acid composition of the feed is calculated as a weighted
mean of all selected protein sources.<br>

These values can be changed.<br>

To guarantee a fixed relationship between the crude protein content and
the sum of amino acids; the content of non essential amino acids are
calculated by difference of crude protein and the sum of essentials.<br>

Please note that the amino acid contents, presented in this window are
including water (like you get them from an amino acid analyses).<br>

For the purpose of calculating non essential amino acids, water-free contents are used.<br>

Simon uses digestible amino acids for the simulations, and assumes for each amino acid the true digestibility value for protein.<br>

The apparent digestibilties, however, differ between amino acids,
because the amino acid profile of the endogenous protein losses differs
from that of feed protein. <br>

<br>

<b>Endogenous protein losses</b><br>

By default, endogenous losses at the terminal ileum are based on the ileal nitrogen flux in calves fed on milk proteins only.<br>

It is assumed that these milk proteins are completely disappeared at the terminal ileum.<br>

For each available protein source, a multiplication factor for the
endogenous protein losses is available, relative to that of milk
proteins (multiplyer set set to one).<br>

In this field, you will see by default the weighted mean for the selected protein sources.<br>

You can change this value if you like.<br>

<h3>Feeding schedule based on nutrients</h3>

In each feeding schedule, a maximum of 6 feeds can be used simultaneously.<br>

Therefore, it is possible to formulate four feeds, each representing one nutrient.<br>

In this way, you can vary nutrient input to Simon direcly.<br>
