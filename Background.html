SiMON (SImulating Metabolism Of Nutrients in preruminants) is a
mechanistic model integrating protein and energy metabolism in
preruminant calves of 80-240 kg live weight.

The objectives SiMON are to gain insight into the partitioning of
nutrients in the body of growing calves and to provide a tool for the
development of feeding strategies for calves in this weight range.

SiMON simulates the partitioning of nutrients from ingestion through
intermediary metabolism to growth, consisting of protein, fat, ash and
water.<br><br>

<span class="incorrect">It contains numerous state variables, comprising fatty acids, glucose,
acetyl-CoA and amino acids as metabolite pools, and fat, ash and protein
 in muscle, hide, bone and viscera as body constituent pools.</span>

Turnover of protein and fat is represented. SiMON also includes a
routine to check possible dietary amino acid imbalance and can be used
to predict amino acid requirements (use) on a theoretical basis.

<span class="incorrect">SiMON is based on two experiments, specifically designed for this purpose.</span>

Simulations of protein and fat accretion rates over a wide range of nutrient input suggest the model is sound.

It can be used as a research tool and for the development of feeding strategies for preruminant calves.
