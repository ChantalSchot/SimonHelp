<h1>Simon - background</h1>

Simon (SImulating Metabolism Of Nutrients in preruminants) is a
mechanistic model integrating protein and energy metabolism in
preruminant calves of 80-240 kg live weight.<br>

The objectives Simon are to gain insight into the partitioning of
nutrients in the body of growing calves and to provide a tool for the
development of feeding strategies for calves in this weight range.<br>

Simon simulates the partitioning of nutrients from ingestion through
intermediary metabolism to growth, consisting of protein, fat, ash and
water.<br>

It contains 10 state variables, comprising fatty acids, glucose,
acetyl-CoA and amino acids as metabolite pools, and fat, ash and protein
 in muscle, hide, bone and viscera as body constituent pools.<br>

Turnover of protein and fat is represented. Simon also includes a
routine to check possible dietary amino acid imbalance and can be used
to predict amino acid requirements (use) on a theoretical basis.<br>

Simon is based on two experiments, specifically designed for this purpose.<br>

Simulations of protein and fat accretion rates over a wide range of nutrient input suggest the model is sound.<br>

It can be used as a research tool and for the development of feeding strategies for preruminant calves. <br>

Flowchart of Simon. Boxes represent pools weer, arrows represent nutrient fluxes<br>

The composite box denotes four protein pools, each with a flux to and from<br>

the amino acid pool. Energy consuming fluxes are indicated&nbsp; with a black<br>

circle, fluxes yielding energy are indicated with a black box though the flux arrow.<br>
