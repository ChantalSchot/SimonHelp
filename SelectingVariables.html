<h3>Making a variable group</h3>

From the list of available variables you can make your own selection.<br>
The output variables that are available depend on whether you have
selected output per time/weight range or at fixed time steps.<br>
Your
selection can contain both types of variables, and after updating your
output table in the output window you will see the available output
variables.<br>
You can see which ones are available by using the "per time
step/range" switch button.<br>
You can choose your variables from all the
available variables in the list left, or you can choose from predefined
categories.<br>

<br>

Use the red arrows to alter the sequence of the variables.<br>
They will
appear in the output window in the order you have included them in your
variable group.<br>
Please note that by default, only the top two of your
group are plotted in a graph.<br>

<br>


<h3>Making a variable group</h3>


After choosing either a range definition based on time or based on weight, you can set each range by entering its end point.<br>
