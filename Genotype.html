<b>Name</b>:
Choose a name for your genotype (max 15 characters) <br>

<br>

<b>Description</b>:
Choose an appropriate description<br>

<br>

<b>Based on</b>:
When defining a new genotype, you will see here which of the three basic genotypes your new one is based on.<br>
The three basic genotypes differ in many parameters, not all of which you can see and change.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of amino acid oxidation</b>:
Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of amino acids for
oxidation and will therefore decrease protein deposition and increase
fat deposition rates.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of fat synthesis</b>:
Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of fatty acids for fat
synthesis and therefore increases fat deposition rate and decreases the
utilization of fatty acids for oxidation.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of fatty acid oxidation</b>:
Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of fatty acids to be used
for oxidation (energy supply) and will lead to a decreased fat
deposition and possibly less oxidation of other nutrients.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of fatty acid synthesis</b>:
Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of Acetyl-Coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA) to be used for fatty acid synthesis.
It will indirectly increase fat deposition and possibly decrease protein deposition.<br>

<br>

<b>Energy requirement for maintenance processes</b>:
Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases energy expenditure on maintenance
processes and will therefore reduce protein and fat deposition.<br>

<em>Please note that differences in maintenance energy expenditure between
genotypes, as far as related to changes in body composition, are already
 accounted for by SiMON. Changing this multiplier is useful to account for differences in
environment (e.g. ambient temperature, group housing systems, etc.).</em><br><br>

<h2 id="HowTo">How-to: Creating new genotypes</h2>

In the genotype window you can create new genotypes based on the three (basic) genotypes for which SiMON is parameterized:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Dutch Black-and-White male calves: 70% Holstein-Friesian x 30% Dutch Friesian </li>
	<li>Dutch Red-and-White male calves</li>
	<li>Dutch Black-and-White male calves (improved)</li>
</ul>

To create a new genotype, you have to select an existing genotype and <b>copy</b> it, which duplicates initial body composition and a complete set of parameters from the existing genotype.<br><br>

You can change five model parameters and consequently some of the nutrient partitioning rules of your genotype. These model parameters are multiplication factors and are set to 1 for the Dutch Black-and-White male calves, but have varying default values for the Red-and-White calves. <em>Keep in mind: </em>Setting default values from Red-and-White calves to 1 will not give you a Black-and-White male genotype, due to other parameter differences you cannot change. It should be noted that SiMON was originally calibrated for Dutch Black-and-White male calves, and the results obtained with this genotype are
more reliable than with the other genotypes.<br>
