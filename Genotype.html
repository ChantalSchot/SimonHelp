<b>Copy</b><br>

You can define a genotype by copying one of the three basic genotypes and make changes from there. <br>

<br>

<b>Delete</b><br>

You can delete any genotype, except for the three basic genotypes.<br>

Upon deletion of a genotype, simulations that make use of this genotype won't work properly.<br>

You can change an existing genotype and save it.<br>

Please realize that old simulations won't produce the same results after this. <br>

<br>

<b>Save</b><br>

You can save your newly defined or changed genotype. <br>

<br>

<b>Restore</b><br>

Undo changes since last save. <br>

<br>

<b>Print</b><br>

Generate a report of the selected genotype for printing or exporting. The report is in HTML format.<br>

<h2><a name="Fields"></a>Fields</h2>

<b>Name</b><br>

Choose a name for your genotype (max 15 characters) <br>

<br>

<b>Description</b><br>

Choose an appropriate description<br>

<br>

<b>Based on</b><br>

When defining a new genotype, you will see here which of the three basic genotypes your new one is based on.<br>

This is important because the three basic genotypes differ in many parameters, of which you can see and change a few.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of amino acid oxidation</b><br>

Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of amino acids for
oxidation and will therefore decrease protein deposition and increase
fat deposition rates.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of fat synthesis</b><br>

Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of fatty acids for fat
synthesis and therefore increases fat deposition rate and decrease the
utilization of fatty acids for oxidation.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of fatty acid oxidation</b><br>

Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of fatty acids to be used
for oxidation (energy supply) and will lead to a decreased fat
deposition and possibly saves oxidation of other nutrients.<br>

<br>

<b>Maximum rate of fatty acid synthesis</b><br>

Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases the priority of acetyl coenzyme A to be used for fatty acid synthesis.<br>

It will, indirectly, increase fat deposition and possibly a decreased protein deposition.<br>

<br>

<b>Energy requirement for maintenance processes</b><br>

Change the default multiplier within the limits.<br>

Increasing this factor increases energy expenditure on maintenance
processes and will therefore reduce protein and fat deposition.<br>

Please note that differences in maintenance energy expenditure between
genotypes, as far as related to changes in body composition, are already
 accounted for by Simon.<br>

Changing this multiplier is useful to account for differences in
environment (e.g. ambient temperature, group housing systems, etc)<br>

<h2><a name="Functionality"></a>Functionality of the genotype window</h2>

In this window you can change the characteristics of three (basic) genotypes for which Simon is parameterized<br>

(Dutch Black and White males and females and Dutch Red and White male calves), thus defining your own genotype.<br>

By selecting a basic genotype, Simon copies its initial body composition and a complete set of parameters.<br>

You can change five model parameters and thereby some of the nutrient partitioning rules that are used for your genotype.<br>

These model parameters are multiplication factors and are set to 1 for the Dutch Black and White male calves.<br>

If you copy a Dutch Red and White male calf as a basis to define your
own genotype, the five multiplication factors will have a different
default value.<br>

Setting these to one will not give you a Dutch Black and White male
calf, because these five parameters are not the only ones in which these
 genotypes differ.<br>

It should be noted that Simon was originally calibrated for Dutch Black
and White male calves, and the results obtained with this genotype are
more reliable than with the other genotypes.<br>
