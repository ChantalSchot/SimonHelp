<title>SiMON help: Graph settings</title>




</head><body>
<h1>Graph settings</h1>

After making one or more graphs, you can change the presentation of each
 graph by selecting the graph and click top-left on "graph" and 
"settings".<br>

You can change the titles of the axis, change scaling and choose an appropriate spot for the legend.<br>

The right part of this settings window shows all variables that are available for the graph.<br>

If the variable of your choice is not available, you will have to make a
 new graph and make sure the table it is based on contains the variable 
you would like to see.<br>

Sometimes, different output variables are difficult to combine in one graph.<br>

In that case, make a new graph based on the same table. <br>

<br>

You can also change the color and style of the lines used or the legend.<br>

If you would like to change other settings, you can go for "more 
options", which invokes the graph generator used by the builders of this
 program.<br>

Numerous options are available, which will not be discussed here.<br>
