<br>
Once the simulation has run, the results can be viewed in the Output window. At the top of this menu, there are three options to view the output: at the end of the simulation, per range (time or weight) and on times within day(s).<br><br>

<b>Extra options:</b>
<blockquote>
	<a href="Graph.html">Graphs</a>: How to make graphs from the output table.<br>
	<a href="RangeDefinition.html">Output Ranges</a>: Define output ranges for the output window (in days or weight).<br>
	<a href="SelectingVariables.html">Variable Groups</a>: Define variable groups that can be selected in the output window (per range or times within day(s) only).<br>
	<a href="ListOfVariables.html">List of Variables</a>: A complete list of available output variables and descriptions.
</blockquote><br>

<b>Important note</b><br>
Depending on your choice of viewing output per time/weight range you may or may not see all variables. For example, live weight gain (LWG, g/d) can be calculated every time step, but not as an average over a certain time or weight range. In that case, you will have to select the variable average live weight gain (avgLWG, g/d). <em>All variables starting with avg (average) or cavg (cumulative average) are only available as range-output.</em> A variable group can consist of several types of variables, but selecting this variable group will only show the results of the variables that correspond with your choice of output range or step.<br>

<br><hr>
<h2 id="endOfSim">Output at the end of the simulation</h2>
Results shown at the <em>end of simulation</em> are a list of selected variables as calculated at the end of the simulation, most representing slaughter data. Output of up to four specified simulations is presented in four columns, one for each simulation. The results can be exported using <em>Menu bar &rarr; File &rarr; Print...</em> (in html format). This list of output variables cannot be adjusted by the user; more tailor-made information and specific variable groups can be viewed in the output <em>per range</em> or times within day(s).<br><br>

<hr>
<h2 id="perRange">Output per range (time or weight)</h2>
Results shown at the <em>output per range (time or weight)</em> are shown for different <a href="SelectingVariables.html">Variable Groups</a>. Every variable represents a new column and every record (row) represents a step in the <a href="RangeDefinition.html">defined time or weight range</a>. If multiple simulations are shown in the same output table, each variable column shows results for each simulation respectively. For example for empty body weight, the first column of Q ew (1) corresponds to simulation 1, the second column of Q ew (2) shows simulation 2, etc.<br><br>

<b id="preferences">Preferences for presenting results</b><br>
Above the output table, there are various options to adjust how the results are shown. Changing these options is possible without re-running the simulations. After changing one or more of the options, make sure to click Update so the changes are applied to the table.<br>
<blockquote>
	<b>Simulation</b>: Check or uncheck simulations that are shown in the table.<br>
	<b>Output ranges</b>: Select a fixed time step (in x days) or averages for a time or weight range (see <a href="RangeDefinition.html">Output Ranges</a>).<br>
	<b>Variables</b>: Show a predefined group of variables (see <a href="SelectingVariables.html">Variable Groups</a>).<br>
	<b>Graph</b>: Create a graph of the results (see <a href="Graph.html">Graphs</a>).
</blockquote><br>

<b>Output tables can be shown in various ways:</b>
<blockquote>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="columnLeft">
			Per day <br>
			Every x days <br>
			Average per time/weight range <br>
			Graphically <br>
		</div>
		<div class="columnRight">
			&rarr; Choose a fixed time step with value 1.<br>
			&rarr; Choose a fixed time step with value x.<br>
			&rarr; Select an <a href="RangeDefinition.html">predefined time/weight range</a> from the drop-down list.<br>
			&rarr; Choose a fixed time step with value 1 and make a <a href="Graph.html">graph</a>.
		</div>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<br><hr>
<h2 id="inDay">Output as times within day(s)</h2>
Results shown as times within day(s) are shown for different moments throughout the day: the time step between each record is 10 seconds. Variables are shown in a similar way as in the Output per range (see section <a href="#perRange">above</a>). In this window, the time step cannot be defined, but it is possible to define the <b>first</b> and <b>last</b> day, showing all time steps of 10 seconds for each of those days in between. Output shown as times within day is useful to see daily fluctuations in variables. Other preferences for output are similar to the output per range (see above).<br>
