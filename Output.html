<title>SiMON help: Output window</title>



</head><body>
<h1>Output window<br>
</h1><a href="#Endofsim">Output at the end of a simulation</a><br>
<a href="#Perrange">Output per range (time or weight)</a><br>
<a href="ListOfVariables.html">List of output variables [separate help page]</a><br>
<h2><a name="Endofsim"></a>Output at the end of a simulation</h2>
<p>In this window you can view the simulation outputs of up to 4 simulations (see <a href="Simulation.html">simulation window</a>).<br>
Only the end-point variables will be shown, which are basically slaughter data.<br>
Results of the different simulations are presented in different columns.<br>
You cannot change anything in this window. For tailor-made output, view the output at different time steps/ranges.<br>
You can export or print this output.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Perrange"></a>Output per range (time or weight)</h2>
<p>In this window you can view the simulation results of up to 4 simulations (see <a href="Simulation.html">simulation window</a>).<br>
The results are shown in the window below and are sorted by the <a href="SelectingVariables.html">selected variables</a>.<br>
The results of the different simulation runs (1 to 4) are presented per output variable in separate columns.<br>
The number of the simulation follows the name of the output variable:
LW[1] means live weight of the first simulation run, LW[4] means live
weight of the fourth simulation run.<br>
</p>
<h3>Setting your preferences for presenting simulation results</h3>
<p>At the top left you can switch the results of a particular simulation run on or off.<br>
You can repeatedly make changes without having to re-run your simulations.<br>
You will, however, have to press the Update button before the output table is actually changed.<br>
</p>
<h3>Defining the time ranges</h3>
<p>You can choose how to view your output variables:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>per day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; choose fixed time step with value 1 </li>
  <li>every x days &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--&gt; choose a fixed time step with value x</li>
  <li>average per defined time range --&gt; select an existing time range from the drop-down list</li>
  <li>graphically&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; choose a fixed time step of 1 and <a href="Graph.html">make a graph</a>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not defined any output time ranges, you can do so in <a href="RangeDefinition.html">main menu, settings (Output ranges)</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3>Selecting the presented output variables </h3>
<p>Select an existing variable group from the drop-down list and click Update.<br>
If you decide to view another variable group, select it and press Update again.<br>
You don't have to re-run the simulations.<br>
  <br>
If you have not yet defined variable groups, you can do so in <a href="SelectingVariables.html">main menu, settings (Variable groups)</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3>Important</h3>
<p>Depending on your choice of viewing output per time step or time range you may or may not get to see certain variables.<br>
Live weight gain (LWG, g/d), for example, can be calculated every time
step, but not as an average over a certain time or weight range.<br>
In that case, you will have to select the variable average live weight gain (avgLWG, g/d).<br>
All variables starting with avg (average), cavg (cumulative average) are only available as range-output.<br>
A specific variable group can consist of several types of variables, but
 selecting this variable group will show the results of the variables
that correspond with your choice of output range or step.<br>
