<b>Feeding schedule based on</b> (switch button)<br>

choose whether you would like the changes in feed intake in the records 
of the feeding schedule to be based on time (age) or on the weight of 
the calves.<br>

Your choice affects the first column of the feeding schedule that you specify in the lower part of the window. <br>

<br>

<b>Feeding schedule</b><br>

enter your feeding schedule here (dependent on your choice of age or weight based). In each record, enter:<br>

<ul>

  <li>the day or weight that the new quantities in this record should be fed (first column)</li>
  <li>select a predefined feed (click twice in this field to get a drop-down list (third column)</li>
  <li>enter the quantity of this feed to be fed (fourth column)</li>
</ul>

repeat this procedure for other feeds and move on to the next record.<br>

This way, you can use up to 6 different feeds on each point in time.<br>

In the second record, specify in the first column the day or weight that you would like the new record to be valid.<br>

So if you enter day 1 in the first record and day 9 in the second 
record, record one will be applied throughout days 1 to 8, and the 
second record will applied starting from day 9.<br>

The last record, by definition, is applied until the end of the simulation. <br>

<br>

Pleas make sure that the quantities you specify in the feeding schedule match the weight range that you want to simulate.<br>

You specify the starting weight in the Simulation window.<br>



<h2><a name="Functionality"></a>Functionality of the feeding schedule window</h2>



In this window you specify the quantity of each feed (defined in the <a href="Feed.html">feed</a> window) given on each point in time to the simulated calf.<br>

The functionality should be clear from the description of the fields.<br>

If you choose to simulate until a target weight (see <a href="Simulation.html">simulation window</a>) then you have to realize that you may reach the target weight before the complete feeding schedule is finished.<br>

It is, however, also possible that it takes longer to reach your target weight than you would anticipate.<br>

In that case, the last record of the feeding schedule is applied until the target weight is reached.<br>
