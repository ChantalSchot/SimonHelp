	<blockquote>
		<b>Day</b>: Starting day on which the specified quantities will be fed.<br>

<h2><a name="HowTo"></a>How-to: Creating and adjusting schedules</h2>
<em>Similar for milk replacers, concentrates and forages.</em><br><br>

In this window you specify the quantity of each feed given on each point in time to the simulated calf. To create a new schedule, either click on the <b>new</b> button or select an existing feed and <b>copy</b> it. Define the name, description and step size for the feeding schedule and place the cursor in the first record of the table (Specification of feeding schedule). Every record (row) in the table defines a feeding schedule for a period of time, starting at the specified 'day' for that record and ending on the day of the next record.<br><br>

For each record, enter a starting day, select one or more feeds (up to 6, defined in the <a href="Feed.html">Feed window</a>) and fill in the corresponding quantities (in g/day) that should be fed each day. For milk replacers only, the daily feeding times (column "Times") should be specified as well, more information about this can be found here: <a href="FeedTimes.html">Feeding Times</a>. Press <b>Ctrl+D</b> to add a new record and repeat the steps. For example, if the first record starts on day 0 and the second record starts on day 9, then the feeds from the first record will be applied during days 1 - 8. The feeds from the second record are applied starting on day 9. Once all records are filled out, click <b>&#10004; Save</b> and the schedule becomes available for simulations.<br><br>

If you choose to simulate until a target weight (see <a href="Simulation.html">Simulation window</a>) then the simulated calf may reach the target weight before the complete feeding schedule is finished. If this is not the case, the last record of the feeding schedule is applied until the end of the simulation.<br><br>

<h3>Tips for creating records in a feeding schedule</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use &lt;TAB&gt; to enter the fields in the table from left to right.</li>
  <li>Delete the selected record (row) with &lt;Ctrl + Del&gt;.</li>
  <li>Select a feed by pressing &lt;space&gt; and subsequently &nbsp;&lt;Alt + &darr; &gt; (arrow down), then <br>
		use the arrow keys to select the feed and press &lt;enter&gt; to confirm.</li>
</ul>
