	<b>Clear</b>: Clears the current input from the search bar.<br><br>
	<b>Search again</b>: Refreshes the search with the current search term(s).<br><br>
	<b>Show zero contributions</b>: Uncheck to show only ingredients that are currently selected (thus have a contribution of at least 1%). Check to show complete list of ingredients.<br><br>
	<b>Increase contribution by one (Enter)</b>: Increase the contribution of the currently selected ingredient by 1%.<br><br>
	<b>Set contribution to zero (Ctrl+Z)</b>: Sets the contribution of the currently selected ingredient to 0% (removing it from the feed), regardless of the previous contribution value.<br><br>
	<b>&Sigma;= 100%</b>: Increases contributions of currently selected ingredients to rate so the sum adds up to 100 (thus total contribution of 100%). <br><br>

Protein sources and their data are presented in 5 columns: <br>

<br>

<b>Name protein source</b><br>

get a drop-down list by clicking in this field and select a defined protein source. <br>

<br>

<b>Contribution to feed</b><br>

enter the percentage contribution of the protein source to total feed protein (not to the feed). <br>

<br>

<b>Endogenous protein factor</b><br>

default multiplication factor for the protein source selected, if it would be the only protein source used.<br>

This multiplication factor is set to one for milk proteins, and generally is somewhat higher for vegetable protein sources.<br>

You cannot change this factor, but after leaving this window, a weighted
 mean is calculated, which you can adapt in the feed window (amino acid
sheet). <br>

<br>

<b>Protein factor</b><br>

gives the crude protein factor (g crude protein/g nitrogen) for the selected protein source. This value is fixed. <br>

<br>

<b>True digestibility coefficient protein</b><br>

gives the true digestibility coefficient for the selected protein source.<br>

You cannot change this value.<br>

After leaving this window, a weighted mean is calculated for the protein sources selected, and used as a default.<br>

You can adapt this value if you like.<br>


<h2><a name="Functionality"></a>Functionality of the protein sources window</h2>


In this window, you can specify your protein sources.<br>

You can choose between skimmed milk powder, whey, soy protein isolate,
soy protein concentrate, soluble wheat gluten protein and potato
protein.<br>

The sum of the contributions has to add up to 100%.<br>

Based on these data, Simon generates default values for protein, fat,
starch and lactose digestibility, the protein to nitrogen ratio, the
amino acid composition and the endogenous protein factor.<br>

You can change these default values when you return to the feed window.<br>

The endogenous protein factor affects energy metabolism and the apparent
 faecal protein digestibility, which can be retrieved as an output
variable (!) in the output window.<br>
