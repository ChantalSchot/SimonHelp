In SiMON, you can have several graphs open simultaneously. For optimal use of the graph options, read the information below. <br><br>

<h3 id="makeGraph">Creating a graph</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A graph can only be created for output per range or times within day(s).</li>
	<li>Make sure the output table is updated before creating a graph.</li>
	<li>Create a graph by clicking <b>Graph</b> on the top right above the <a href="Output.html">output</a> table (not visible at <em>end of simulation</em>).</li>
	<li>Time is shown on the X-axis and each graph can only have one unit on the Y-axis.</li>
	<li>Specify the Y-axis variable(s) by clicking <em>Menu bar &rarr; Graph &rarr; Settings</em>, then select variables you wish to see.</li>
	<li>By default, only the first two variables from the output are shown. See <a href="#advanced">advanced settings</a> below for more information.</li>
	<li><b>Multiple graphs</b> can be made simultaneously (see <a href="#advanced">advanced settings</a> below).</li>
	<li>Each graph can be adjusted separately and will have its own settings.</li>
</ul>

<br><hr>
<h3 id="advanced">Advanced graph settings</h3>
Open graph settings by clicking <em>Menu bar &rarr; Graph &rarr; Settings</em>.<br><br>

<b>Graph layout</b><br>
In the settings window, the basic layout elements of the graph can be adjusted manually by changing:
<ul>
	<li>Legend, scale and range of X-axis and Y-axis</li>
	<li>Location of the legend</li>
	<li>Description of the legend</li>
	<li>Visibility of background grid</li>
	<li>Graph title</li>
</ul>
Numerous advanced layout options can be adjusted (e.g. fonts, title, ...) by clicking <b>More options...</b> at the bottom right corner of the settings window (these are not discussed here further).<br><br>

<b>Variable selection</b><br>
Variables can be selected by checking or unchecking the "visible" column in the Settings list. If a variable is not available, the output needs to be updated (for example, choose another variable group) so you can create a new graph that contains the variable you wish to plot. Line style and color of each variable can be adjusted by clicking on the corresponding line (in the settings window), which allows manual adjustment of style, colour and thickness.<br><br>

<b>Multiple graphs</b><br>
Multiple graphs can be made at the same time. Minimize (do not close) a graph, update the output table and create a new graph to have two graphs at the same time. By clicking <em>Menu bar &rarr; Windows &rarr; ...</em> you can choose to show multiple graph windows as overlapping or adjacent to each other, or just drag them where you want. New graphs are numbered sequentially (e.g. Graph 1, Graph 2, Graph 3, ...) as long as the previous graph has not been closed. Layout and settings can be adjusted for each graph separately.<br><br>

<b>Export options</b><br>
Graphs can be exported or saved by clicking <em>Menu bar &rarr; Settings &rarr; ...</em>
<ul>
	<li>"Print..." allows printing or saving the graph as pdf (Print to PDF).</li>
	<li>"Save as" allows exporting the file as bitmap or meta file.</li>
	<li>"Copy" will copy the graph, allowing you to paste it in another program.</li>
</ul>
