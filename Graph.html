<h1>Graph</h1>



In Simon, you can have several graphs open at the same time.<br>

For optimal use of the graph options, it is important to read the following paragraphs carefully. <br>

<h3>Making a graph </h3>

<ul>

  <li>you define a graph in the <a href="Output.html">output</a> window (per time step/range)</li>
  <li>you can only make graphs when you selected a fixed time step of 1 day (and subsequently pressed Update to update the table)</li>
  <li>time will always be the X-variable.</li>
  <li>a graph is always based on the output you saw in the table in your output window at the time making the graph.<br>
You can only plot variables that occur in that list.</li>
  <li>you can create more graphs (and have them on your screen simultaneously).<br>
These graphs can, but don't have to be, based on the same table.</li>
  <li>graphs you make will be numbered automatically (graph1, graph2, etc.)</li>
  <li>all graphs can have only one Y-axis</li>
  <li>each graph will carry its own settings.<br>
You can change these by clicking top-left on "graph" and then "<a href="GraphSettings.html">settings</a>".</li>
  <li>by default, only the first two variables in the output list will
be plotted in the graph. you can change this, as described above.<br>
You can also adapt the sequence in the variable list and make sure the ones you would like to see are on top.</li>
</ul>

If you would like more information, see <a href="GraphSettings.html">advanced graph settings</a><br>
