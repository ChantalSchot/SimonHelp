<h1>SiMON - main menu</h1>

Starting from the main menu, you can choose from 6 basic windows.<br>

Although these windows will, after a while, be used in random order, they will be described from left to right. <br>

<br>

Before you can perform a simulation, you will have to specify what genotype you would like to use in the simulation (<a href="Genotype.html">Genotype</a>).<br>

Next, the feeding schedule has to be prepared. You can define your feeds in the <a href="Feed.html">Feed</a>
 window, and the combination of the feeds and the quantities given to 
the simulated animal at any point in time can be specified in the <a href="Schedules.html">Feed Schedules</a> window.<br>

Now you can start a simulation in the <a href="Simulation.html">Simulation</a>
 window, in which you combine genotype with feeding schedule and specify
 a desired initial live weight and length of the simulation (in days or 
in terms of target weight).<br>

You can specify up to 4 simulations, which will be run after each other 
but the results can be viewed simultaneously for the 4 simulations in 
the <a href="Output.html">Output</a> window.<br>

In the output windows, you can view results in <a href="Output.html#Perrange">table</a>, or in <a href="Graph.html">graphical</a> form. In all available windows, you can ask for help by clicking the help item in the main menu. <br>
